## Insights


1. China had early high case numbers but managed to flatten the curve quicker than others.
2. Kenya's vaccination progress was slower compared to Nigeria and China.
3. The death rate in Nigeria fluctuated more than in Kenya and China.
4. There's a strong correlation between new cases and new deaths.
5. China has the highest total vaccinations among the three countries.
